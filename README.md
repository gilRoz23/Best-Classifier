# Project Overview

This project involves data preprocessing and training multiple machine learning models on a dataset. The dataset is loaded from a pickle file, and several preprocessing steps are performed before training and evaluating various classification models. The models used include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

# Instructions

## Data Loading and Exploration

### Load the Dataset

Load the dataset and explore its structure, data types, summary statistics, and handle missing values.

```python
# Example Python code for data loading and exploration
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_pickle("path_to_your_dataset.pickle")

# Display dataset structure
print("Dataset structure:")
print(data.head())

# Check data types
print("\nData types:")
print(data.dtypes)

# Summary statistics
print("\nSummary statistics:")
print(data.describe())

# Check for missing values
print("\nMissing values:")

Exploring and Preprocessing Data
Explore the dataset to understand its characteristics before preprocessing. This includes checking for any missing values, ensuring all columns have the correct data types, and handling any necessary data transformations.

Model Training and Evaluation
Train Classification Models
Train several classification models using the preprocessed dataset:

python
Copy code
# Example Python code for model training
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize models
log_reg = LogisticRegression()
dec_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier()
rand_forest = RandomForestClassifier()
adaboost = AdaBoostClassifier()

# Train models
log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
dec_tree.fit(X_train, y_train)
rand_forest.fit(X_train, y_train)
adaboost.fit(X_train, y_train)
Evaluate Model Performance
Evaluate the trained models on a validation or test set to assess their accuracy:

python
Copy code
# Example Python code for model evaluation
log_reg_pred = log_reg.predict(X_test)
dec_tree_pred = dec_tree.predict(X_test)
rand_forest_pred = rand_forest.predict(X_test)
adaboost_pred = adaboost.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate accuracy
print(f"Logistic Regression Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, log_reg_pred)}")
print(f"Decision Tree Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, dec_tree_pred)}")
print(f"Random Forest Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, rand_forest_pred)}")
print(f"AdaBoost Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, adaboost_pred)}")
Visualize Results
Optionally, visualize the results using plots or metrics to compare model performances.

Notes
Modify paths and configurations as per your dataset location and project setup.
Adjust model parameters and preprocessing steps based on specific project requirements.
print(data.isnull().sum())
